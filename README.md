# nextjs examples

---

All sample next sites live within the `/examples` directory.

Next is installed at the root, but will run within sub directories as well.

## Get going

- At repo root run `npm install`
- Within each example run: `npm install`
- in each example run: `npm run dev` to see the live version

## Table of Contents

- [`examples/json-page`](examples/json-page/)
  - Shows how to return JSON from a Page route instead of an API route. This is helpful for instances like Health Check or Status pages.
- [`examples/share-page-props`](examples/share-page-props/)
  - Shows how with a [Custom \`App\`](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-app) you can share page props among different components.
